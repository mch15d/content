                        Gordon College i« to train young Sudanese to
                        be of use to the Government and to the com-
                        munity, whether they afterwards become
                        kadi«, schoolmasters or artisans. andthrtthe
                        founders of the College forget that such an
                        institution set down in the midst of a
                        barbarous and newly conquered country had
                        to have small beginnings. The College was
                        certainly in its beginnings a primary school
                        for black boys—it is difficult to see how it
                        oould have been anything else, for whatever
                        the capabilities of the Sudanese youths
                        for absorbing higher or even secondary educa-
                        tion without any tiresome primary training,
                        these do not spring up from the soil, and I
                        believe that European educational systems are
                        based without exception on a course of pri-
                        mary education, whioh is generally supposed to
                        be a necessary preliminary to more advanced
                        study. The chief event in the history of the
                        Gordon College during 1905 was the creation
                        of an Upper School, which already oounts 15
                        pupils. This may not seem an immense nrm-
                        her, but education was to put it mildly—
                        primitive at the time of th9 reoonqnest, and
                        Upper Schools are not oreated in a day. Tb«
                        time, however, oame when its oreation was
                        considered feasible, and Mr.Currie the Director
                        of Education in the Sadan, having obtained
                        the fundi, decided to oonsult the principal
                        officials of the Technical Departments efrthe
                        Sadan Government, vis, the Director of
                        Works, the Director of Surveys, and ihe
                        Director General cf Irrigation, with a view to
                        learning tbeir opinions as to the training most
                        required in the rew Upper School, and as to
                        what type of employ^ would be most useful
                        to the Government.
                        The following reply from Mr. Dupuis, the
                        Inspector General (f Irrigatirn in the Sudan
                        deserves special attention by all who are
                        interested in the spread of education not in the
                        Sadan oi ly, bnt in all backward eonitries in
                        the East. The principles it lays dc wn for the
                        training of engineers are fqaally applicable
                        in Persia, Mesopotamia and the central Sudan,
                        and the‘future organisers of higher technical
                        education in those regions will doubtless profit
                        by the results attained at the Gordon Collepe.

                        surveyorsIf all or even some of th* large

                        enormous deman i for men wfth at leant an
                        elementary knowledge of surveying, land
                        measuring and simple oonstruotion.
                        The convenience and economy of being able
                        to obtain suoh men locally, instead of hwing to
                        tempt them away from Egypt by the offer of
                        salaries often out of all proportion to their
                        sooial standing and qualifications, would be
                        immense, and theadvan'age to anew country

                        some engineering trailing oould not but be
                        very great.
                        The special kind of qualification for which a
                        demand would arise on the undertaking of sooh
                        works as are contemplated would ba those

                        construction of simple masonary works.

                        accounts in any simple and oomprebensibl
                        form, would be a most rsetul additional quali-
                        fication.
                        Imagine the case of the consfruotion of a
                        large canal system say in the Ghezira; the first
                        step would be the retting out of the lines of the
                        oanals, and the demarcation and expropriation
                        tf the areas of laud they would occupy ; these
                        lires would extend certainly over hundreds,and
                        probably over thousands of kilometres.
                        The next step would be the ex^ontion of th;
                        necessary earthwork over there lines, an im
                        mense business, and by no means so a mple a-

                            In gnperv sing any snnh wo»k it would be
                            necessary or derirable to kepp a running

                            elementary knowledge of acoount keeping

                            A very large demard for rongh but efficient

                            "he application of locally available material
                            (generally mnd, grass, and in'erior timber) for

                            great use.
                            So far I have been considering tfie use of
                            suoh men regarded as overseers or supervisors,
                            and working as subordinate employes in a
                            1-yge organi-ed staff of engineers ; but they
                            would be at least equally nseful as petty con-
                            tractors or gangers working at “ piece work,”
                            •ndeed.the line dividing the temporarily engag-
                            ed overseer on small pay from the petty con-
                            tractor, often becomes very fine indeed.
                            I think I have ssid enough to show the
                            nature tf work f r which men of the most
                            elementary qualifications are required, bdt if
                            you are prepared to go further, there is nothing
                            to prevent suoh meu being trained and educat-
                            ed into fully qualified engineers.
                            For this course^ «he first necessity is deeper
                            knowledge of mathematics, and a cultivated
                            reasoning power, to permit of the formation of
                            intelligent forecasts of the probable course of
                            events under given conditions.
                            The nse of the level is a more or ISRS me-
                            chanical operation, and might easily acquired

                            inner bearings, and it is a qualification of the
                            ntmost value ; but I should not expeot reliable
                            results from the use of a theodolite by a man
                            of limited mathematical attainments; more-

                            I have therefore divided the snbjeots in which
                            training might in my opinion be attempted,
                            into two classes, which I denote “sub-overseers”
                            and engineers”, olassed respectively after an
                            old Indian clss^ifiobtion.
                            I apologise beforehand for the obvioos im-

                            the practical o^jeots to be ob’ained. I have no
                            experience in the preparation courses of

                                syllabus to guide me, and it is undoubtedly a

                        The dcotors < f New York are growing more
                        and more alarmed about the proportion of
                        sodden deaths, mainly fr m heart disease, and
                        this they attribute to the killing pace at which
                        New Yorkers live. Five and twenty years aco,
                        they point out, the death rate was only 13 J
                        per cent, whereas in 1904 it was 1 7 per rent,
                        aud the ratio is inorearing. “The awful con-
                        dition of life in this city,” remarkel an

                        without having to oonsult an index. The hand-

                        A TOUCHING TALE.
                        Eighteen months ago a deserted infant was
                        found by the roadside at Clonghton, a village
                        outside Scarborough. The child was taken
                        care of by Mr. John L?adley, a farmer, and
                        member of the beard of guardian*, and the
                        mother having been traced, she was prose-
                        ou^ed. The oironmstanoes surrounding the
                        girl’s downfall were tonnd to be very pathetic,
                        and as she h\d been more sinned against
                        than sinning, no pnnishment was i< flicted. A
                        «ew*paper report of the faota wa=* read by
                        a gold miner iu British Columbia, ard his
                        heart was so touched that he forwarded an
                        offer of marriage, together with a sum of
                        £30 for the girl’s passage out. She went,
                        and was married the day after she landed.
                        Last week she returned for the child, whioh
                        had been ado; t’d by a sympathetic carter's
                        wife at Searner, and on Saturday the happy
                        mother and child sailed from Liverpool to
                        rejoin the hnsband. By the time the mother
                        regains British Columbia she will have tra-
                        velled forne 8,000 miles on the child’s account

                    R* battino Co.’s steamers which leave Alex-
                    andria weekly for MESSINA, where one takes
                    train to TAORMINA, one of the mo t charm-
                    jng and popular places on the island. G*auli• i
                    is he station at which to alight, and the drive
                    up to Taormina is most delightful, occupying
                    about one hour. In and around the town is
                    much to interest the visitor. The theatre is of
                    Greek origin, but restored under the Romans.
                    CATANIA is the starting place for the ascent
                    of Etna and here also is a fine Cathedral. The
                    Greek, Roman, and Saracenic remains that
                    are found all over the island, are an endless
                    sources of pleasure. SYRACUSE has an
                    interesting history, having been a Greek
                    city, which was designed by Demosthenes in
                    B.C. 413, and taken by the Romans in B.c. 212,
                    when Archimedes was slain his tomb is to be
                    seen. The cathedral was onoe an ancient pagan
                    temple. PALERMO, with abo t 300,000
                    inhabitants, is the capital of the Island, and
                    enjoys a delightful climate. Much of interest
                    is to be found in this fine city. The Palazzo
                    Reale is of Saracenic origin and close to it the
                    church of S. Gi ivannia degli Eremiti with its
                    picturesq'-e cloisters. The Cathedral, Museum,
                    Botanic Gardens, Villa Giulia and Royal Park
                    are also worth a visit

                    being only 3 days.
                    NAPLES is also reached in 10 hours from
                    Palermo by the Florio-R* battino Co.’s steam-

                    Naples or leave it without wishing to explore
                    some of its islands, besides the lovely places
                    on its bay— Castellamare and Sorrento. The
                    small steamer that takes you to Sorrento [you
                    can drive tool will take you on to Capri.
                    From Naples to ROME is a train journey of
                    but five hours. All who can will devote at
                    least one week to visiting the many historical
                    and interesting portions of the Eternal City,
                    whose charms and beauties are too well-known
                    to need comment here.
                    Leaving the Eternal City with mnoh regret,
                    a railway journey qf'five hours brings you to
                    FLORENCE, where another week can well be

                    churches and galleries are of absorbing inte-
                    rest, whilst the local promenades and excur-
                    sions should not be omitted. The Caseins is
                    the most attractive and fashionable promenade
                    in Florenoe, whilst the Vials dei Colli, one of
                    the finest walks in Europe, opened 35 years
                    ago, goes winding up through the hills a
                    distance of four miles. The most delightful
                    exenrsiop outside Florence is that te Vailom-
                    brosa, with its Monastery 3,300 feet above the

                    from Florence to St. Ellero, thenoe by cog-
                    wheel railway to Saltino. The ascent through
                    groves of oaks takes an hour, and most
                    striking panoramas are unfolded to view.
                    PISA is easily reached from Florence in
                    about 2 hours ; here there is a fine Cathedral
                    and the Leaning Tower. A stay of at least one
                    night should if possible be made, in order to
                    enjoy the view from the Campanile at sunset.

                    good.
